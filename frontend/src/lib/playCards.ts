// The cards of the play page's first level (.scratch/play-hub spec「卡片注册表」): for each card, its
// name, where it goes (its subpage), when it is shown, what its status line says and whether a dot
// sits by its name. A card is one entry of `CARDS`; the page lays them out (the first across a
// whole row, the rest in a grid) and only asks what is on them. Gifts and achievements are made of
// the gift state, which the first level and the subpages read alike; the calendar (.scratch/calendar
// spec「玩法页的『日历』卡」) of the characters' birthdays, the producer's and the holidays, and is
// there whether affinity and gifts are open or not; the cycles (.scratch/cycle-page spec「玩法页的卡」) of the
// periods the user wrote down, there only while the deployment and the user have cycles on.
