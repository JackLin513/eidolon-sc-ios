"""The draws behind moments (GLOSSARY.md「朋友圈」): given what they go by and a random
source, what comes of them, reading nothing and writing nothing, so that the background loop
and the eval alike take them as they are.

The day's plan (`plan_day`): each character eligible is drawn for once, by her tier
(`CHANCES`); on her birthday, in Tokyo, she posts whatever is drawn. Over as many as the user
may have a day, those whose birthday it is are kept first, the rest drawn among. One with jobs
the producer scheduled her that are done that day in Tokyo posts of them (`work`), within
`AFTER_WORK` after the last is done (`work_time`); one planned after that is over, and the
others, of their everyday (`daily`), each given a time in Tokyo after the moment planned at: a part of the day drawn by its weight
(`PARTS`), then a time in it, at least `APART` from the user's others; one there is no time
left for posts nothing that day.

Her everyday moment's seeds (`draw_seeds`): `SEEDS` entries of her facts, but for those of
the people she knows (`RELATIONS`), each as likely.

Her places (`draw_places`): as many as `CANDIDATES`, for her to say she was at one or at
none, of the places right for the season and the time of day she posts at in Tokyo, and none
the user's moments were at within the last `KEPT_APART`; in rain, snow or thunder, only those
under a roof. A venue is one only on a day she stood on it in a year before, and is then hers
before any is drawn; the rest are drawn by weight, one of a kind she likes weighing `LIKED`
times as much, her holy site `HOLY` times. Of her work moment, only of the kinds of place her
jobs take her to, each as likely.

Every draw asks the random source for a number below `PLACES`, so that one giving the same
number each time draws alike wherever it is asked."""
