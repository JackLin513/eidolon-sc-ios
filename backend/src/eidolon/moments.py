"""Moments (GLOSSARY.md「朋友圈」「动态」): what the characters post to each user's own
moments, of their days, for that user alone to read.

Only where the deployer turns them on (`LiveConfig.moments`), on the deployer's chat model.
Every `TICK` the backend runs what is due (`run_due`): first each user active and not yet
planned for today in Tokyo is planned for, then each moment whose time has come is posted, one
after another in the order of their times.

A user is active who has been in touch with any character within `ACTIVE`: a turn recorded,
or a call that connected ending (`store.read_in_touch`); gifts are not being in touch. Not a
banned user, nor one an admin lets take no turns on the deployer's keys, nor one who has
switched moments off by their own switch (`switch`), on by default. Planned for at the
first tick of the day in Tokyo they are active at, from the rest of the day
(`moment_draws.plan_day`): of the characters they have had a turn with, in trust or above and
not in a cooldown (trust where affinity is off), each drawn for once; as many as the deployer
sets a day at most. One with jobs in the user's schedule done that day in Tokyo, done already
or not yet, posts of them, after the last is done; the others, and one planned too long after
that, of their everyday (`kind`); all of their everyday while schedules are off. Once planned, a user is not again that day: a
character first talked to, or come up to trust, that day waits for the next. The plan is
kept, and read again after a restart.

While the deployer has moments off, nothing is planned nor posted; turned on again, what was
planned is forgotten, and each user planned for anew from what is left of the day. A user
who switches their own off is left as they are planned, and planned for, once on again, as
any other: what is not due yet is posted, and one not yet planned for that day is planned
for from what is left of it. While either has them off, the user's moments are refused them
(`MomentsOff`), kept as they are.

As a moment's time comes, it is looked at again: the deployer still has moments on; the user
is still active, not banned, nor let take no turns; she is in trust or above and not in a
cooldown; the user has had fewer moments of its day than the deployer sets. If not, it is
passed over, for good. One whose time came before the backend started is passed over too,
not made up for. Each is taken off the plan once posted or passed over. One of her jobs whose
time comes as she is still at one, the producer having scheduled her more since, is put off
till after the last as it was planned, past midnight if so, still of the day planned for.

She posts on the deployer's chat model as text turns use it, whoever's LLM the user brings,
held only while she does: nothing counts towards the user's limits. Her prompt is put
together from what is read beforehand (`moment_prompt.PostMaterial`): what she knows of now on
the `moments` occasion; her jobs done that day, each its name and what it is, or else
`SEEDS` entries of her facts; the memories she was told herself, found with the last turn of
her current conversation (`Memories.for_reaching_out`); her latest `RECENT` moments; as many
as `moment_draws.CANDIDATES` places of the pool for her to say she was at one of
(`moment_draws.draw_places`), of her jobs only of the kinds they take her to, only those
under a roof in rain, snow or thunder; Tokyo's weather as she posts (`weather`), kept with the
moment, none if it cannot be had; and, where there is image generation, the compositions her
picture may be in (`moment_draws.draw_compositions`), a group photo among them only in
NovelAI's own format, with those of her circle who have photo tags. Each has an activity record of its own (`moment`), on the
deployer's keys, its service calls under it, and what of it was made do without
(`moment_prompt.Post.degraded`); one the model fails, or writes nothing to post in, is
recorded failed, and not tried again. Her picture is generated first, on the deployer's image
generation, behind every photo waiting (`Photos.picture`), by `PICTURE_TIME_LIMIT` at the
latest, waiting its turn included; one that fails or takes too long is no picture, the moment
posted all the same, and recorded a success. What she posts is posted as it is written: that
is when it shows.

She posts it with her circle (`moment_draws.draw_circle`), of the other idols, the office's
staff in no one's: her unit mates, as the world setting has them; those a section of her
facts on the people she knows is on, by their names in its heading (but for those on the
producer and on the other idols, `NOT_ONE`); and the others. Of those she writes like it and
comment on it, each shows at a time of its own (`moment_draws.draw_shown`), whatever comes of
her affinity or her cooldowns after.

The timeline (`timeline`) is the user's moments of the last `KEPT`, the latest first, each
place with a link to it on the map the deployer chooses (`map_link`), each with the likes
and comments of her circle that have shown, in the order they did, and where its picture is
(`picture`): the user's alone to read, as their photos are.

The producer may like a moment on his timeline, and no longer (`like`): only whether he does
now is kept, she never knows what was. He may comment on it once (`comment`), from 1 to
`COMMENT_LENGTH` characters but for the spaces around them, kept as he wrote it, and delete it (`uncomment`), her
reply with it, then comment again, a comment as any other. As he comments, she is to reply in
her tier, within `moment_draws.REPLY_AFTER` (`draw_reply`), trust where affinity is off; never,
cold to him, distant, or in a cooldown. As her time comes, with the moments due, in the order
of their times, it is looked at again: the deployer and the user still have moments on; she
is not cold, distant or in a cooldown; it did not come before the backend started; she has replied to
fewer of his comments that day in Tokyo than the deployer lets her (`MomentSettings.replies_per_day`), counted by the records of her replies
(`moment_reply`) that succeeded, as a reply deleted with its comment counts still. If not, she
does not, for good, unrecorded. She replies on the deployer's chat model, whoever's LLM the user
brings (`moment_prompt.reply_prompt`), with the memories she was told herself; one the model
fails, or writes no reply in, is recorded failed, and not tried again. Her reply shows as it is
written, unless his comment was deleted meanwhile, when it is recorded rejected. Neither a like,
a comment nor a reply changes her affinity, is remembered, or is being in touch."""
