"""Invite links (GLOSSARY.md「邀请链接」): while the deployment takes only those invited
(GLOSSARY.md「注册方式」, ADR-0006 revised 2026-10-29), a new identity signs up only through
one an admin made. Each may be used a number of times, `MAX_USES` at most and never without
end, for a link anyone could use for ever would be signing up open to all; and may expire.

A use is counted only as it makes a new user, in the same write (`admit`), so that two
signing up at once through its last use cannot both; deleting the user does not give it
back. Who signed up through which link is kept (`invited_users`), for admins to tell
through which a stranger came in: it is the user's, deleted with them, and goes when the
link is deleted. The links are kept as they are, not hashed, so that admins can copy them
again: each is 128 random bits, and backups are encrypted.
