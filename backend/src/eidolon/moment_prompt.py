"""What she is asked as she posts a moment (GLOSSARY.md「朋友圈」「动态」), and what is read of
what she writes: from material put together beforehand, reading nothing, so that the
background loop, which reads it from the database, and the eval, which has it written,
take the same prompt and the same parser.

The prompt is laid out as a turn's (ADR-0020): her character sheet and the world setting as
every turn has them, word for word, the turn's format replaced with how to post
(`POST_RULES`); who the producer is; no history; then, in a system message of its own, what
she is to know as she posts (`PostMaterial`); and where the user's words would be, that she
wants to post (`WANTS_TO_POST`).

She writes the whole of it before it is read, not streamed: her post, in Japanese with its
Chinese subtitle, `<post><ja>…</ja><zh>…</zh></post>`. Either missing, it fails. Delivery
cues are left out of both, but for what else is in brackets: her kaomoji are hers to post.
Then where she is, `<place>…</place>`: one of the places she was given (`PostMaterial.places`)
by its identifier, or none. One she was not given, or none written where she was given any,
is made do without: the moment has no place, none drawn in its stead, and it is told
(`Post.degraded`, `PLACE`).

She is told of her circle (`PostMaterial.circle`), those who may like and comment on her
moment: each by identifier and name, what her facts say of her, and how she speaks (her
sheet's sections in `SPEAKS`). She writes who likes it, `<likes>…</likes>`, and each comment,
in the order they show, `<comment from="…"><ja>…</ja><zh>…</zh></comment>`, naming them by
identifier, though their names and short names will do. Each part is made do without on its
own, and told: a list of likes not written is no one's (`NO_LIKES`); one not in her circle
is left out (`OUTSIDE_LIKER`), as is a comment by one, or without its Japanese or its subtitle
(`BROKEN_COMMENT`); those over as many as `LIKES` and `COMMENTS`, or on her birthday
`BIRTHDAY_LIKES` and `BIRTHDAY_COMMENTS`, are left out, the last first (`LIKES_OVER`,
`COMMENTS_OVER`).

Where her moment may have a picture (GLOSSARY.md「配图」), she is told last in what compositions
(`PostMaterial.compositions`, `COMPOSITIONS_OPENING`), and writes it as a photo tag is written,
`<image>…</image>`, its composition among its fields, and a note in Chinese of what is in it,
never sent: kept with the moment, what her latest moments are recalled by (`recalled`). One
not written, in a composition she was not given, of an object with nothing in it, or that
cannot be read, is made do without: the moment is posted without a picture, and it is told
(`IMAGE`). One she writes where she was not told she may is not read. A framing not of its
composition is not made do without: it is from the waist up.

Where it may be a group photo, she is told which of her circle may be in it with her (those
with photo tags, `GROUP_MARK`), and names them in `with`. One with no one named, or one not of
them, is a posed photo of her alone instead, and it is told (`WITH`). Whoever is in it with her
likes her moment, written so or not, and is never one of those over as many as are kept."""

你在发一条朋友圈动态，事务所的同伴、朋友和制作人都看得到。
- 用日语写一到三句、最多一百字左右，像随手发的一条近况，再附上中文字幕。
- 表情和颜文字按你自己的性格：平时爱用就用，不爱用就不用。
- 不用 # 话题标签，不用 @，不加语气提示。
- 有「今天做完的工作」时，把这几项串成一条写；「日常的素材」可用可不用。
- 换个话题，别和「你最近发的朋友圈」重复。
- 关于制作人的记忆只能隐约呼应，不要复述；他私下告诉你的事不要点明。
- 可以提到「プロデューサーさん」，但关系再亲近也不写成情侣的口吻。
- 「此刻」里没写天气时，正文别提天气和冷热。
- 地点只能从「地点候选」里挑一个，写它的 id；在家、在宿舍，或者候选里没有合适的，写 none。
- 正文里提不提地名随你，要提就用日语自然地写。
- 标了「你的卡面在这里拍过」的候选，只借那里的景，不说「这是我那张卡拍的地方」。
- 「圈子成员」里的人会来赞、来评论，人数照那一节说的；名单里只写她们的 id。
- 每条评论用评论的人自己的口吻（照她的自称、称呼和口癖），一两句、最多四十字左右，日语加中文字幕。
- 评论只回应正文和配图里写出来的东西（配图看你写的 note），以及她和你之间的关系；没写的事不提，不对制作人说话。
- 评论按出现的先后写，后面的可以顺着前面的接一句。
- 有「这次允许的构图」时带一张配图。正文不依赖配图，配图没发出来也读得通。
- 工作那条从做完的几项里挑一项来配图。
- 写街景时写站在地面能看到的东西（sidewalk、power lines、vending machine、storefront、crosswalk 一类），只写 street, dusk 会画成从高处俯瞰。
- 风景、食物、物品的 action 写景物、食物或物品，不是动作；outfit、framing 不用写。
- 摆拍和抓拍可以选 wide shot：人小景大，适合在名胜、街景前。
- 合照想拍成自拍，就在 action 里写 selfie；不写就是别人帮你们拍。
- 只输出下面的格式，不写别的：
<post><ja>日语正文</ja><zh>中文字幕</zh></post>
<image>配图标签</image>（只在有「这次允许的构图」时写）
<place>候选的 id 或 none</place>
