"""The bar over HTTP (GLOSSARY.md「酒吧」「光顾」), for users who agreed to the terms:
`/api/bar` reads it; `/api/bar/visits` begins a visit, each of whose drinks is served at
`/api/bar/visits/{visit_id}/serves`, on the keys it came in with, and which is left by
deleting it. Beginning a visit and serving a drink answer with the call they set off, as
server-sent events (`bar.BarEvent`).

Refused: coming in while the bar is closed (409 `bar_closed`), or over the limit (429, as any
use is); any visit but the user's under way (410 `visit_gone`); serving while she is not
waiting for a drink (409 `not_waiting`), or what is none of the drinks (422
`broken_drink`)."""
