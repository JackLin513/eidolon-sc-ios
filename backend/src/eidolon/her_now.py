typing, in a call, reaching out (GLOSSARY.md「搭话」), visiting the bar (GLOSSARY.md「光顾」),
posting a moment (GLOSSARY.md「朋友圈」).

`HerNow` gives it in two steps. The first reads: her jobs, counting those done, so that her
affinity read after it has them counted; where her cycle has her; her job done today; her
latest moments, where the occasion tells her of them; and, for a visit, her affinity too. The
second gives the lines of now for the occasion, as its table (`CARRIES`) has them, from what
the first read and what the caller read besides (the producer profile, when they were last in
touch, the affinity lines, the weather). The weather, typing, in a call or reaching out, the
caller reads on its own (`weather`), once it has the producer profile (`her_weather`). Her latest moments, as the first
read them, make a section of their own (`recent_moments.moments_section`). Where in the prompt
they go is the caller's to say (ADR-0020).

What every prompt of hers opens with (her sheet, her birthday, the world setting) is not now:
it stays the same all day, for a service to cache (`today.always_known`)."""
