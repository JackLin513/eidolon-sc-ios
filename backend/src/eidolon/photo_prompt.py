"""What a photo is generated from (GLOSSARY.md「照片」): the photo tag she wrote, read field by
field, and the prompts the image service is sent for it.

She writes how the photo is taken (`shot`: a selfie, or someone else taking it), how much of
her it shows (`framing`), and three fields of English tags: where and when (`place`), what
she wears (`outfit`), what she does and how she looks (`action`); and a note in Chinese for
herself alone, never sent. What she writes is cleaned before it goes anywhere: the prompt
syntax NovelAI reads (emphasis, weights, alternation, comments, quotes, `Text:`) is
stripped, the tags put in lower case with spaces for underscores, and those the model
does not know as tags put as it does, by the local tag table (`photo_tags.json`, made by
`scripts/photo_tags.py` from NovelAI's tag suggestions); one it has no word on is kept as it
is, and logged. A tag crossing the line (ADR-0023: nudity, underwear, see-through, bathing,
a sexual pose or look) is stripped, as is one of her looks, an art style or an artist, or
anyone else in the picture, holding hands among it: only that tag, the photo taken all the
same of the rest (`PhotoTag.stripped` says which part of the line each stripped crossed, for
the activity records, never the tag). Each is written once, and each field cut to its most; a field left
empty gets its default. Swimsuits, pajamas, lying on a bed, a pool and the beach are not
crossing it. Neither the deployer nor any user changes the table.

The positive prompt is fixed around them: who she is (her character tag and the work's
tag), the deployment's art style, written in as the deployer wrote it (weights, artists
and all; none if empty), her looks, the tags for how the photo is taken, `rating:general` and V5's standard
quality tags, written out rather than left to the service's switch. The negative prompt is
fixed altogether: `nsfw`, the Human Focus preset, and what no photo of hers shows
(ADR-0023). Neither the deployer nor any user changes them.

A moment's picture (GLOSSARY.md「配图」) is written and cleaned as a photo is, in one of the
compositions she is let choose (`Composition`), each with prompts of its own
(`picture_prompt`). Three have no one in them (`UNPEOPLED`): scenery, in Japan, outdoors;
food; an object. Their `action` is what is in the picture, their `outfit` and `framing` not
read; anyone she writes into one is stripped too (`1girl`, `solo`, `selfie`, the work's tag
and the idols' own, where anyone looks, what anyone holds); food with nothing in it is `food`, an object with nothing in it no
picture. Three have her alone in them: a selfie, as a photo's; one someone else takes of her
posing, looking at the camera; one someone takes of her unawares, looking elsewhere, at a depth
of field. Those two may show her small (`wide shot`); a framing not of its composition is from
the waist up. Where she is alone or no one is, no one holds hands (`people`). Scenery is
landscape (`LANDSCAPE`), the others portrait, as photos are.
