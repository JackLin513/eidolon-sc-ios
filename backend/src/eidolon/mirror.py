"""The ShinyColorsDB mirror of the game's decoded scripts and Spine stands, and its API
(ADR-0004, ADR-0011), with the game's own asset server behind it (ADR-0032).

The API (`api.shinycolors.moe`) lists every idol and her cards, and each card's
episodes with the game script they are in and their title, and the stands each of her
dresses has; the viewer (`viewer.shinycolors.moe`) serves the scripts themselves, as
the game does, and the CDN (`cf-static.shinycolors.moe`) the stands' files. Neither
publishes terms or a rate limit and both are run by volunteers, so requests go out
one at a time, about a second apart, and a script already downloaded can be asked
for conditionally, on its ETag, as can an album. Keeping the scripts is not the
mirror's business: that is `script_cache`.

A script or a stand's file the mirror does not have, or cannot send, is asked of the
game's asset server (`official_cdn`), which the mirror copies them from: new ones are
often there first. Only the files: which cards there are, their episodes and dresses,
come from the API alone. The server answers a file it does not have with the game's
page, as it would answer everything while down for maintenance; so when the mirror
could not be reached, that page means the server has no such file only once it has
sent a file this time, and until then it is the mirror's error.
