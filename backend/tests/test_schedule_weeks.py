"""Each week's jobs (GLOSSARY.md「工作」): published at Monday 0:00 Beijing time, the week named
by that Monday's date; seven of the idols, never the office's staff, each given two or three
jobs from the job list, 24 to 27 slots in all, no job twice in a week, at least one of work
and at most one private each; every idol once in four weeks running. Drawn as a week is first
read and kept, the same for everyone, and kept as it was when the list changes.

The producer reads their week (`/api/schedule`) in their own time zone (their profile's, else
their device's, else Shanghai's): this week, and next week once it is published, which is
already on their Sunday west of Beijing; east of it, their Monday's first hours come before
their week is published, and they are told when it will be."""
