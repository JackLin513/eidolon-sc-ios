"""Her words read aloud (GLOSSARY.md「朗读」): a reply of hers or a reach-out, in any of the
user's conversations with her, voiced whole in one request to Fish Audio's HTTP API at its
best quality, a line to each segment, its delivery cues as the model voicing it reads them
and the readings as its pronunciation dictionary, and answered as mp3, nothing of it kept.
On the user's own key for speech synthesis with the model they chose, counting towards
nothing; else on the deployer's with the deployer's model, counting towards the user's
read-alouds an hour, given back if Fish Audio fails. Each is a service call of speech
synthesis, billed as a call's is.

Driven through the backend's external API, Fish Audio faked at its transport."""
