"""What a visit to the bar done gives (GLOSSARY.md「光顾」「抽奖」「好感度」): the day's first
done, by the Beijing day she came in on, gives a draw chance, held to the most kept
(`affinity.MAX_DRAWS`), and raises her affinity by how well each drink was served, averaged
(`affinity.SERVED_STEPS`), in a cooldown too, out of it at the thaw line, beyond the day's
limit; told of as the visit is done, and to the navigation as a reward is, but as no
conversation event. Later visits that day give nothing, nor does one left before it is done,
nor any while affinity and gifts are off. Reading the bar tells whether there is a reward
today.

Driven through the backend's external API; her affinity read from the database, as only its
tier is shown. Mano is the only character, ordering as `test_bar_visit` has her."""
