"""Her moment's picture (GLOSSARY.md「配图」): where the deployer has image generation, she is
told last what compositions it may be in, and writes it as a photo tag is written; it is
generated on the deployer's image generation before the moment shows, in prompts fixed by its
composition, at its size, and kept with it as WebP without metadata, the user's alone to read.
Where she has no photo tags, only those no one is in; without image generation, none. One she
writes amiss, or that fails or takes too long, leaves the moment without a picture, posted all
the same. Pictures wait their turn with photos, each photo ahead of every picture waiting.

Driven as `test_moments.py` drives moments (`SteadyRandom(0)`: every moment has a picture), the
image service faked at its transport, where every request it is sent is seen."""
