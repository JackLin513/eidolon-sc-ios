"""Saving jobs into the producer's schedule (GLOSSARY.md「日程」「时间段」): each placed at a day
of their week and the slot it starts in, as many slots in a row as it is long, in their own
time zone. Saved is for good: nothing saved is moved or taken back. What cannot be placed is
handed back with why, as the browser tells it, the rest saved: a slot begun or past, one
taken by another job (saved before, or earlier in the same saving), one the job may not be
in, a job too long for what is left of the day; a week not published, a job not of the week,
a job saved already. Two saving into the same slot at once save one of them.

Driven through the backend's external API, the week's jobs kept beforehand in the database
(`publish`), as the week's draw would have kept them."""
