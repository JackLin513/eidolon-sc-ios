Tokyo's always, from Open-Meteo, and where the producer has a city in their profile and the
deployer a QWeather account, where the producer is and the weather and the warnings there. She
is always told it, but may bring it up herself only after they have long been apart, or on a
day that stands out, or with a warning in force; nothing of it she cannot have in time.
